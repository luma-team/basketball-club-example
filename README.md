# Luma Basketball Club

This is an example website showing how you can integrate the Luma API into your website. In this example, we are using a fictional basketball club based in New York City.

For this project, we are using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) and the [Luma API](https://docs.lu.ma).

## Running the Project

```sh
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run the web server
pnpm dev
```

## Configuration

You’ll need to use your own Luma API key and add it to a new file `.env.local`. You can use the `.env.local.template` as a starting point.
