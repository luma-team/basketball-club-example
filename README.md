# Luma Basketball Club

This is an example website showing how you can integrate the Luma API into your website. In this example, we are using a fictional basketball club based in New York City.

For this project, we are using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) and the [Luma API](https://docs.luma.com).

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/luma-team/basketball-club-example) | [Live Demo](https://basketball-club-example.luma-dev.com) | [Luma Calendar](https://luma.com/nycbball)

## Running the Project

```sh
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run the web server
bun dev
```

## Configuration

Youâ€™ll need to use your own Luma API key and add it to a new file `.env.local`. You can use the `.env.local.template` as a starting point.
